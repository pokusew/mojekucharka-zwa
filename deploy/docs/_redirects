# Netlify redirects and rewrites config
# see https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/
# useful tool for quick validation: https://play.netlify.com/redirects
# notable caveats:
# - the rules are processed in order from top to bottom, so the most specific rules comes first, then add general ones
# - ! after status code forces the rule even if file matching the URL exists
#   see https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/#shadowing
# - all rules are trailing-slash-insensitive as all URLs are normalized before the rules are processed
#   see https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#trailing-slash
# - rules in the _redirects file are always processed first, followed by rules in the netlify.toml


# force HTTPS
# (actually not needed since it's handled automatically by Netlify)


# Pretty canonical URLs
# not needed when Settings > Build & deploy > Post processing
#   > Asset optimization - Pretty URLs is enabled (or via netlify.toml)
# TODO: Pretty URLs setting does not seem to take any affect
#       and it causes CDN side-effects so it is disabled and handled manually here
# /index.html    /    301!
# /index         /    301!


# if this were a fully client side only SPA (Single Page App)

# /*    /index.html    200


# 404 not applicable in SPA
# as everything may be valid URL since routing is done on the client side
# # 404 custom error pages
# # TODO: add localized versions once translations are implemented
# # prevent 404.html from being viewed directly with 200 OK code and thus get indexed
# /404.html    /404.html    404!
# /404         /404.html    404!
# # 404 when no file matches URL
